This was created for a FreeCodeCamp project in the JS course.

The purpose of this function is to take: 
1. price
2. cash given
3. cash in drawer

It will then either return:
1. "Insufficient funds" (if there isn't enough change in the drawer)
2. "Open" + change given (if there is enough change in the drawer)
3. "Closed" (if the change in the drawer is exactly the changed owed)
